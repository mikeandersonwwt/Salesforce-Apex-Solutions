PROBLEM:
#94 - Safe Navigation Operator

Implement the method getAccountBillingCityWithSafeNavigation, which accepts a list of accounts 
as an input and returns the BillingCity in upper case of the first account in the list. 
Use the Safe Navigation (?.) to ensure null is returned in case the BillingCity is null.

Given the following test code:
List<Account> acts = new ListList<Account>();
acts.add(new Account(Name = 'Acme', BillingCity = 'Chicago'));
acts.add(new Account(Name = 'Dove', BillingCity = 'Boston'));
String result = getAccountBillingCityWithSafeNavigation(acts);

result should be 'CHICAGO'

Hint 1:
Use the toUpperCase method defined in the String class to convert the BillingCity to uppercase. 
If the BillingCity is null, however, using the toUpperCase method would throw an exception which 
can be prevented with the safe navigation operator.

Hint 2:
It is possible to solve this with an if condition to check for a null value, but the 
safe navigation operator offers a cleaner solution.

SOLUTION:

public String getAccountBillingCityWithSafeNavigation(List<Account> accounts){
   return accounts?.get(0)?.BillingCity?.toUpperCase();
}
