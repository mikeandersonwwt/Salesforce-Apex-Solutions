PROBLEM:
#16 - Sum 1 to N

Implement the method sumToN that calculates and returns the sum of all numbers (inclusive) 
from 1 to n. Assume that n will be non-zero positive integer.

sumToN(5) = 15
sumToN(2) = 3

Hint 1:
You can use a for loop to loop through integers 1 through n, and keep adding them to a variable.

Hint 2:
You may remember a different approach from a Math class: there is a very simple formula to 
calculate the sum of the first n Natural Numbers.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public Integer sumToN(Integer n) {
    Integer total = (n * (n + 1))/2;
    return total;
}
