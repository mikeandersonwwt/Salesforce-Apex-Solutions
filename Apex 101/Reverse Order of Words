PROBLEM:
#113 - Reverse Order of Words

Implement a function reverseWordsInASentence that will take a String containing words 
separated by spaces as an argument, and return a string with the order of the words reversed.

Example : If the sentence is The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, then 
reverseWordsInASentence(String sentence) should evaluate to dog lazy the over jumps fox brown quick The

Hint 1:
First, reverse the whole sentence then reverse the words of that sentence.

Hint 2:
If you are failing the first test case then make sure that there are no additional spaces 
before or at the end of the reversed words sentence.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public String reverseWordsInASentence(String sentence){
    if (sentence == null) {
        return null;
    }
    List<String> words = sentence.split(' ');
    List<String> reversedWords = new List<String>();
    for (Integer i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversedWords.add(words[i]);
    }
    String reversedSentence = String.join(reversedWords, ' ');
    return reversedSentence;
}
