PROBLEM:
#137 - Tip Calculator

Create a function that given a total bill, and an integer percentage value 
between 0 and 100, computes the tip at the specified percentage. You can assume 
the percentage specified will be an integer within the valid range.

For an example, computeTip(200.0, 50) evaluates to 100.0, because 50% of 200 is 100.

Hint 1:
A tip is just a percentage of the total value. To obtain the percentage, multiply 
the total by the percent, and divide by hundred.

Hint 2:
In case it becomes relevant, recall that integer division in Apex results in truncation. 
However, if one of the operands is a double, the other integer is promoted to a double as well. 
For example:
System.debug(5/2); // outputs 2 
System.debug(5.0/2); // 2.5 
System.debug(5/2.0); // 2.5 
System.debug(5.0/2.0); //2.5

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public Decimal computeTip(Decimal total, Integer percent) {
    Decimal tip = (total * percent)/100.00;
    return tip;
}
