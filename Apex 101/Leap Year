PROBLEM:
#6 - Leap Year

A year is considered a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4, with the exception of years 
that are also evenly divisible by 100. Years evenly divisible by 100 must also be evenly 
evenly divisible by 400 to by considered leap years. Implement a method isLeapYear that takes 
as input an Integer year and returns true if the year is a leap year, and false otherwise.

isLeapYear(1900) = false. Year 1900 is evenly divisible by 4, but it is also evenly divisible 
by 100 which means it additionally needs to be evenly divisible by 400 to qualify as a leap year. 
1900 is not evenly divisible by 400.

isLeapYear(2000) = true. Year 2000 is evenly divisible by 4. It is also evenly divisibly 
by 100, which means it additionally needs to be evenly divisible by 400, which it is. 
Therefore, it is a leap year.

isLeapYear(2004) = true. Year 2004 is evenly divisible by 4. It is not divisible by 100, 
and therefore a leap year.

isLeapYear(1933) = false. Year 1933 is not evenly divisible by 4, and therefore not a leap year.

Hint 1:
Use the Math.mod function to calculate the remainder after a division. A remainder of 0 
means the first input was evenly divisible by the second.

Hint 2:
Apply the logic using if else statements: if number is not divisible by 4, it is not a 
leap year. Else if it is not divisible by 100, it is a leap year. Else if it is not divisible
by 400, it is not a leap year. Else, it is a leap year.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public Boolean isLeapYear(Integer year) {
    if (Math.mod(year, 4) != 0) {
        return false;
    } else if (Math.mod(year, 100) != 0) {
        return true;
    } else if (Math.mod(year, 400) != 0) {
        return false;
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}
