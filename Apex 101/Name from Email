PROBLEM:
#11 - Name from Emil

Implement a function nameFromEmail that takes as input a valid email address in the format 
firstname.lastname@example.com. The function should extract the first name and last name 
from this email address and return a capitalized full name (i.e. FirstName LastName). 
Assume that the input will always be a valid email address with both the first name and 
last name separated by a period (.).

nameFromEmail('john.doe@apexsandbox.io') = 'John Doe'
nameFromEmail('JANE.DOE@GMAIL.COM') = 'Jane Doe'

Hint 1:
There are multiple ways to solve this problem and multiple methods in the String class that 
you can utilize. These include indexOf, indexOfChar, toLowerCase, substring, substringBefore, 
substringBetween, and capitalize. See the documentation of the String class for details on these methods.

Hint 2:
Use a substringBefore methods to extract the substring occuring before the '.' character. 
Then, use a substringBetween method to extract the substring occuring between the '.' and '@' characters. 
Finally, use toLowerCase and capitalize methods to fully extract the first and last name.

SOLUTION:

public String nameFromEmail(String email) {
    String first = email.substringBefore('.').toLowerCase();
    first = first.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + first.substring(1);
    String last = email.substringBetween('.','@').toLowerCase();
    last = last.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + last.substring(1);
    return (first + ' ' + last);
}
