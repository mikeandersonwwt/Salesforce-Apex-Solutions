PROBLEM:
#9 - Full Name

Given two non-empty strings firstName and lastName, return the name as a single string with 
a space in between (firstName lastName).

formatName('Jane', 'Doe') = 'Jane Doe'

Hint 1:
Use the + operator to concatenate strings together into a single string.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public String formatName(String firstName, String lastName) {
    fullName = (firstName + ' ' + lastName);
    return fullName;
}
