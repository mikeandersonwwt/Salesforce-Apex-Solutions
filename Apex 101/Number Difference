PROBLEM:
#4 - Number Difference

Implement a function diff that calculates the absolute difference between two integers.

diff(5, 2) = 3
diff(2, 5) = 3

Hint 1: One approach is to use an if statement with a comparison operator to determine which Integer is the larger integer. Then, subtract the smaller integer from the larger integer.

Hint 2: You may also use the Math.abs function to calculate the absolute value of a number. Subtract one number from the other, and use Math.abs to calculate the absolute value.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public Integer diff(Integer a, Integer b) {
    if( a > b){
        return a-b;
    } else {
        return b-a;
    }
}
