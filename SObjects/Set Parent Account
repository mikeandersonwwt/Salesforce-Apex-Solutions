PROBLEM:
#66 - Set Parent Account

Implement the method setParent that takes as input an account acc, a contact con, and an 
opportunity opp and sets the account is the parent for both the opportunity and contact. 
Make sure to not take any action if the provided account or its Id is null.

Given the following test code:
Account acc = new Account(Id = '0018c00002CQU9EAAX');
Contact con = new Contact(LastName = 'Smith');
Opportunity opp = new Opportunity(Name = 'Coding Bootcamp');
setParent(acc, con, opp);

The expression opp.AccountId == '0018c00002CQU9EAAX' && con.AccountId == '0018c00002CQU9EAAX' 
returns true because both the contact and the opportunity now have acc as the parent account.

Hint 1:
Set the parent by assigning the account's Id (if present) to the contact and opportunity's AccountId field

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public void setParent(Account acc, Contact con, Opportunity opp) {
    // If the account or account Id is not null then add the id to both
    if (acc != null && acc.Id != null) {
        con.AccountId = acc.Id;
        opp.AccountId = acc.Id;
    }
}
