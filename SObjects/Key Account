PROBLEM:
#60 - Key Account

For this problem, we define minimum annual revenue thresholds an account must meet to be 
considered a key account. The annual revenue thresholds are defined by industry:
Banking: 600,000
Technology: 800,000
Retail: 2,000,000
All others: 500,000

Implement the method isKeyAccount that takes as input an Account with the AnnualRevenue 
field and the Industry picklist fields filled out, returns true if the account is a key 
account, and returns false otherwise.

Account a1 = new Account();
a1.AnnualRevenue = 750000;
a1.Industry = 'Technology';
The expression isKeyAccount(a1) should return false because the annual revenue does not 
meet the minimum threshold of 800,000 for the technology industry.

Hint 1:
Use if/else statements to check the Industry, and return a value based on the AnnualRevenue.

Hint 2:
You can also use a switch statement to test for different values of the Industry field. 
For each case, check the AnnualRevenue and return an appropriate value.

SOLUTION:

public Boolean isKeyAccount(Account a) {
    //code here
    if (a.Industry == 'Banking' && a.AnnualRevenue >= 600000) {
        return true;
    } else if (a.Industry == 'Technology' && a.AnnualRevenue >= 800000) {
        return true;
    } else if (a.Industry == 'Retail' && a.AnnualRevenue >= 2000000) {
        return true;
    } else if (a.AnnualRevenue >= 500000 && a.Industry != 'Banking' && a.Industry != 'Technology' && a.Industry != 'Retail') {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
