PROBLEM:
#67 - Set Parent Case

Implement the method linkParent that takes as input two cases c1 and c2, and sets the case 
created first as the parent of the case created later only if both cases look up to the same 
Contact. Ensure to handle the special case where the cases do not have any related contacts.

Given the following two cases:
c1
Id: '5008c00001GHfeUAAT'
CreatedDate: 2022-01-17 05:15pm GMT
ContactId: '0035f00000A4REqAAN'
Subject: 'Not able to log in'

c2
Id: '5008c00001GHfeoAAD'
CreatedDate: 2022-01-19 2:34pm GMT
ContactId: '0035f00000A4REqAAN'
Subject: 'User not created in system of record'

and given the following test code: linkParent(c1, c2);

The case c1 should be set as the parent of case c2 since they are both related to the 
same Contact and c2 was created after c1.

Hint 1:
The Case object has a lookup to itself through the ParentId field. Set a case as a 
parent of another by setting the value of the ParentId field on the child case.

Hint 2:
DateTime values can be compared just like numbers: dt1 < dt2 evaluates to true if 
DateTime dt1 occurs before DateTime dt2.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public void linkParent(Case c1, Case c2) {
    // Check if the cases have related contacts
    if (c1.ContactId != null && c2.ContactId != null) {
        // Check if the cases have matching contacts
        if (c1.ContactId == c2.ContactId) {
            // Chek which case has an earlier created date and assign parent
            if (c1.CreatedDate < c2.CreatedDate) {
                c2.ParentId = c1.Id;
            } else if (c2 .CreatedDate < c1.CreatedDate){
                c1.ParentId = c2.Id;
            }
        }
    }
}
