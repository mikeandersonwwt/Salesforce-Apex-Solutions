PROBLEM:
#61 - Escalate Case

In-progress cases dealing with mechanical or electrical breakdown need to be escalated. Implement a 
method escalateIfMeetsCriteria that takes as input a Case record, and sets the IsEscalated field to 
true if Type is Mechanical or Electrical, Reason is Breakdown, and Status is In Progress

Given the following test code:
Case c = new Case();
c.Type = 'Mechanical';
c.Reason = 'Breakdown';
c.Status = 'In Progress';
escalateIfMeetsCriteria(c);

The expression c.IsEscalated should evaluate to true because the case meets the criteria for escalations.

Hint 1:
Use if/else statements to check the Type, Reason and Status combinations, and set the IsEscalated field if necessary.

Hint 2:
Remember to set the IsEscalated field only when a case needs to be escalated. 
The code should not de-escalate cases under any circumstances.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public void escalateIfMeetsCriteria(Case c) {
    if ((c.Type == 'Mechanical' || c.Type == 'Electrical') 
        && c.Reason == 'Breakdown' 
        && c.Status =='In Progress') {
            c.IsEscalated = true;
    }
}
