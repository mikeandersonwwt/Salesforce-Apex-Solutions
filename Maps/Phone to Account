PROBLEM:
#85 - Phone to Account

Implement the method phoneToAccount that takes as input a list of Accounts, and returns a 
Map containing the phone number as a key and the Account record as the value. Do not include accounts without a phone number.

For example, given the following accounts:
a1
Name: 'Acme Enterprises'
Phone: '2143452398'

a2
Name: 'Universal Containers'
Phone: '6923849837'

The method call phoneToAccount(new List {a1, a2}) should return a map containing the 
following key/value pairs:
'2143452398' -> a1
'6923849837' -> a2

Hint 1:
The put method in the Map class allows you to add a key/value pair to a map.

Hint 2:
Declare a new variable of type Map. Loop over the account list and use the put method to put each  key/value pair into the map, provided the Account's Phone is not null. Finally, return the map.
