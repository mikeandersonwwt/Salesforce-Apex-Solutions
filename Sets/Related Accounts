PROBLEM:
#82 - Related Accounts

Implement the method accountIds that takes as input a list of Opportunity records, and 
returns a set containing IDs of related accounts.

Given the following test data:
Opportunity opp1 = new Opportunity(Name = 'Opportunity 1', AccountId = '0015f00000CtulqAAB');
Opportunity opp2 = new Opportunity(Name = 'Opportunity 2', AccountId = '0015f00000CtulqAAB');
List<Opportunity> opps = new List<Opportunity> {opp1, opp2};

The expression accountIds(opps) returns a Set<Id> containing the single Id 0015f00000CtulqAAB 
since both opportunities were related to the same account.

Hint 1:
Accounts are related to Opportunities through an AccountId field on the Opportunity object.

Hint 2: 
Create a new Set<Id> to hold Account Ids. Loop through the passed Opportunity records and 
whenever an opportunity has a related Account, add it to the set.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public Set<Id> accountIds(List<Opportunity> opps) {
    // Create a new set to store the ids
    Set<Id> accountIdSet = new Set<Id>();
    // Loop through the opportunity records and add id if not null
    for (Opportunity opp : opps) {
        if (opp.AccountId != null) {
            accountIdSet.add(opp.AccountId);
        }
    }
    return accountIdSet;
}
