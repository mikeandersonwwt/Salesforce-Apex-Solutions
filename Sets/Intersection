PROBLEM:
#77 - Intersection

An intersection between two sets A and B is a set that contains all elements present in 
both A and B. For example, the intersection of sets {1, 5, 10} and {1, 3, 5} is {1, 5}, 
since 1 and 5 are the only two elements present in both sets.

Implement the method setIntersection that takes as input two sets of integers set1 and set2 
and returns the intersection of the two sets. The method should not modify the original sets.

Given the following test code:
Set<Integer> set1 = new Set<Integer> {1, 2, 3};
Set<Integer> set2 = new Set<Integer> {4, 3, 2};
Set<Integer> set3 = setUnion(set1, set2);
The set set3 contains the numbers 2 and 3.

Hint 1:
Consider using the contains and add methods defined on the Set class.

Hint 2:
Start by creating a new Set. Loop over all elements in set1, and add each element into the 
new set only if the element is also present in set2.

Hint 3:
You can also clone one of the sets and use the retainAll method to retain only the elements 
present in the second set.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public Set<Integer> setIntersection(Set<Integer> set1, Set<Integer> set2) {
    // Create a new set
    Set<Integer> set3 = new Set<Integer>();
    // Add all elements from set1 & set2 then return set3
    set3.addAll(set1);
    set3.retainAll(set2);
    return set3;
}
