PROBLEM:
#128 - Active Students

Implement the method selectActiveStudents that returns a list of all apxio__Student__c 
records with apxio__Active__c field checked. Make sure the students have a value in the 
Id and Name fields.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:
apxio__Student__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Active__c

Hint 1:
Use a SOQL query to retrieve records

Hint 2:
Use the WHERE clause of the SOQL query to filter out only active students

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public List<apxio__Student__c> selectActiveStudents() {
    return [
        SELECT  Id, Name
        FROM    apxio__Student__c
        WHERE   apxio__Active__c = TRUE
        AND     Name != null
    ];
}
