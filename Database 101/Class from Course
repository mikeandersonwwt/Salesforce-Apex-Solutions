PROBLEM:
#134 - Class from Course

Implement the method classFromCourse that takes as input a string courseName, creates an 
apxio__Class__c record associated with the course named courseName, and returns the Id of 
the new record. The new class should have the same Name as the course.

You should not create a new apxio__Course__c record. The new class should be linked to the 
course that already exists in the database. In case no course with the given name is found, 
do not create any class record and return null.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:
apxio__Course__c
apxio__Class__c
apxio__Class__c.apxio__Course__c

Hint 1:
Use a SOQL query with a WHERE clause to retrieve the existing apxio__Course__c record. 
Use a bind variable in your SOQL query to make sure you only retrieve the necessary record.

Hint 2:
Assign the results of the query to a variable of type List<apxio__Course__c> instead of 
apxio__Course__c. Even though the SOQL query will never return more than one record for our 
test cases, assigning to an sObject instead of a List will throw an error if zero records are returned.

Hint 3:
Copy the Id of the apxio__Course__c record into the lookup field on apxio__Class__c record.

Hint 4:
The Id should be available on the record right after the insert statement. 
You do not need a SOQL query to retrieve the Id of the inserted record.

SOLUTION:

public Id classFromCourse(String courseName) {
    // Query for existing course with the same name
    List <apxio__Course__c> existingCourses = [
        SELECT  Id 
        FROM    apxio__Course__c
        WHERE   Name = :courseName
        LIMIT   1
    ];
    // If no course is found, return null 
    if (existingCourses.isEmpty()) {
        return null;
    }
    // Get the Id of the first (and only) course found
    apxio__Course__c existingCourse = existingCourses[0];
    //Create a new class record associated with the existing course
    apxio__Class__c newClass = new apxio__Class__c(
        apxio__Course__c = existingCourse.Id,
        Name = courseName
    );
    //Insert the new record and return its id
    insert newClass;
    return newClass.Id;
}
