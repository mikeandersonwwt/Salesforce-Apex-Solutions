PROBLEM:
#130 - Unreachable Students

Implement the method selectUnreachableStudents that queries for and returns a list of all 
active apxio__Student__c records that are unreachable because they are missing both an 
email and a phone number. Make sure to include the Id and Name fields in the result. 
The returned list should be sorted A-Z on Name.

For example, given the following list of students in the database:

Student Name    Phone           Email                   Active
--------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Crumley   (791)232-9976   brian@apexsandbox.io    true
Paulina Smith                                           true
Azeem Khan                      ak@apexsandbox.io       true


The method should return a list with a single record for Paulina Smith

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:
apxio__Student__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Active__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Phone__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Registration_Number__c

Hint 1:
Use a SOQL query with a WHERE clause to get the records from the database.

Hint 2:
Use the AND operator in the WHERE clause to make sure the queried records meet the criteria

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public List<apxio__Student__c> selectUnreachableStudents() {
    return [
        SELECT      Id, Name
        FROM        apxio__Student__c
        WHERE       apxio__Active__c = TRUE
        AND         apxio__Phone__c = null
        AND         apxio__Email__c = null
        ORDER BY    Name ASC
    ];
