PROBLEM:
#129 - Students Missing Info

Implement the method selectStudentsWithoutContactInfo that queries for and returns a list of all active apxio__Student__c records that are missing an email, phone, or both. Make sure to include the Id and Name fields in the result. The returned list should be sorted A-Z on Name.

For example, given the following list of students in the database:

Student Name    Phone           Email                       Active
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
Brian Crumley   (791)232-9976   brian@apexsandbox.io        true
Paulina Smith                   psmith@imaginaryemail.xyz   true                     
Azeem Khan                      ak@apexsandbox.io           true

The method should return a list containing Azeem Khan at index 0 and Paulina Smith at index 1

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:
apxio__Student__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Active__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Phone__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Registration_Number__c

Hint 1:
Use a WHERE clause in your SOQL query to filter records.

Hint 2:
Use the AND and OR operators to write the correct condition in the WHERE clause.

SOLUTION:

public List<apxio__Student__c> selectStudentsWithoutContactInfo() {
    return [
        SELECT      Id, Name
        FROM        apxio__Student__c
        WHERE       apxio__Active__c = TRUE
        AND         (apxio__Email__c = NULL OR apxio__Phone__c = NULL)
        ORDER BY    Name ASC
    ];
}
