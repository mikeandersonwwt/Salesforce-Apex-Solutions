PROBLEM:
#133 - Student List

The method insertStudents takes as input two lists of strings studentNames and studentEmails. 
The two lists will always have the same size, with studentNames[i] and studentEmails[i] 
(for any in-range value of i) representing a student's name and email.

Write an implementation of the method that creates apxio__Student__c records for each entry 
in the lists with the Name and apxio__Email__c fields filled out.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:
apxio__Student__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c

Hint 1:
Loop over the lists and create an apxio__Student__c record for each element.
    
Hint 2:
Make sure you bulkify your code! Salesforce only allows 150 DML statements in a single execution context.

Hint 3:
Start by creating a variable of type List<apxio__Student__c> to hold apxio__Student__c records. 
Loop over the provided lists and use the add method from the List class to add each record 
to the list. Once the loop is complete, perform a single DML operation to insert all the 
records at once.

-------------------------------
SOLUTION:

public void insertStudents(List<String> studentNames, List<String> studentEmails) {
    // Create a list to hold all student records
    List<apxio__Student__c> studentRecords = new List<apxio__Student__c>();

    // Loop over the provided lists of student names and emails
    for (Integer i = 0; i < studentNames.size(); i++) {
        // Create a new student record
        apxio__Student__c student = new apxio__Student__c();
        student.Name = studentNames[i];
        student.apxio__Email__c = studentEmails[i];
        // Add the student record to the list
        studentRecords.add(student);
    }
    
    // Perform a single DML operation to insert all the records at once
    if (!studentRecords.isEmpty()) {
        insert studentRecords;
    }
}
