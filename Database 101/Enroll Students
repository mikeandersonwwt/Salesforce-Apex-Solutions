PROBLEM:
#135 - Enroll Students

Implement the method enrollStudents that takes as input a list of strings emails and a 
string className. The method should enroll all students with the provided emails into a 
class with the given name by creating apxio__Class_Enrollment__c records.

Note that apxio__Student__c and apxio__Class__c records already exist in the database.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:
apxio__Student__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c
apxio__Class__c
apxio__Class_Enrollment__c
apxio__Class_Enrollment__c.apxio__Student__c
apxio__Class_Enrollment__c.apxio__Offered_Class__c

Hint 1:
Use SOQL queries to retrieve apxio__Student__c and apxio__Class__c records from the database. 
Make sure you include a WHERE clause with bind variables to ensure you are retrieving only 
the relevant records.

Hint 2:
Loop over apxio__Student__c records retrieved using SOQL, and create a new 
apxio__Class_Enrollment__c record for each student. Make sure you populate the 
apxio__Student__c and apxio__Offered_Class__c lookup fields on the enrollment record.

Hint 3:
Make sure to bulkify your code by avoiding SOQL queries or DML statements inside the loop. 
Make sure your SOQL queries execute before the loop, and your DML statement executes after 
the loop.

SOLUTION:

public void enrollStudents(List<String> emails, String className) {
    // Query for students with the given emails
    List <apxio__Student__c> students = [
        SELECT  Id, apxio__Email__c 
        FROM    apxio__Student__c
        WHERE   apxio__Email__c
        IN      :emails
    ];
    // Query for the class with the given name
    apxio__Class__c offeredClass = [
        SELECT  Id
        FROM    apxio__Class__c
        WHERE   Name = :className
        LIMIT   1
    ];
    // Create a list to hold the records
    List<apxio__Class_Enrollment__c> enrollments = new List<apxio__Class_Enrollment__c>();
    // Loop through students and create new records
    for (apxio__Student__c student : students) {
        apxio__Class_Enrollment__c enrollment = new apxio__Class_Enrollment__c();
        enrollment.apxio__Student__c = student.Id;
        enrollment.apxio__Offered_Class__c = offeredClass.Id;
        enrollments.add(enrollment);
    }
    // Insert new records
    if (!enrollments.isEmpty()) {
        insert enrollments;
    }
}
