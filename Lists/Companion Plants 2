PROBLEM:
#55 - Companion Plants 2

Some plants are considered companion plants. They grow better when planted next to each 
other. For the purpose of this problem, we consider the following plants to be companions: 
lettuce and cucumbers, lettuce and onions, onions and carrots, and onions and tomatoes. 
The same plants planted next to each other are not considered companions.

Write a function isCompanion that takes as input a list of plants being planted in a row. 
Return true only if every plant in the list is planted next to a companion and return false otherwise.

companionPlants(new List { 'onions', 'lettuce', 'onions', 'carrots', 'onions', 'lettuce', 'cucumbers'}) = true
companionPlants(new List { 'lettuce', 'onions', 'carrots', 'lettuce', 'cucumbers'}) = false. 
We have non-companion plants carrots and lettuce planted together

Hint 1:
Loop over elements 0 to size-1, and for each iteration determine if the current element and 
the next element are companions

Hint 2:
Try determining if a pair being examined are companions using the following if/else logic: if 
the first plant is onions, the second should be lettuce, carrots, or tomatoes. If the first plant 
is lettuce, then the second should be cucumbers or onions. If the first plant is cucumbers, the 
second should be lettuce. If the first plant is carrots, the second should be onions. If the first 
plant is tomatoes, the second should be onions. If none of the above match, the plants are not companions.

SOLUTION:

public Boolean companionPlants(List<String> plants) {  
    // If there is only one plant it has no companion
    if (plants.size() == 1) {
        return false;
    }
    // Loop over the list of plants, checking consecutive pairs
    for (Integer i = 0; i < plants.size() - 1; i++) {
        String plant1 = plants[i];
        String plant2 = plants[i + 1];
        // Check if the two plants are companions
        if (!areCompanions(plant1, plant2)) {
            return false;  // If any pair is not a companion, return false
        }
    }
    // If all pairs are companions, return true
    return true;
}

// Helper method to check if two plants are companions
private Boolean areCompanions(String plant1, String plant2) {
    if (plant1 == 'onions') {
        return (plant2 == 'lettuce' || plant2 == 'carrots' || plant2 == 'tomatoes');
    }
    if (plant1 == 'lettuce') {
        return (plant2 == 'cucumbers' || plant2 == 'onions');
    }
    if (plant1 == 'cucumbers') {
        return (plant2 == 'lettuce');
    }
    if (plant1 == 'carrots') {
        return (plant2 == 'onions');
    }
    if (plant1 == 'tomatoes') {
        return (plant2 == 'onions');
    }
    // If no match is found, the plants are not companions
    return false;
}
