PROBLEM:
#111 - Insert at Beginning

Implement a method that would take an element and a List of elements as arguments and 
return the same List with the element inserted at the 0th position.

For example, executing the snippet below:

List<String> cities = new List<String> {
  'Seattle',
  'Cairo',
  'London'
};
insertAtStart('Mumbai', cities);
should modify cities to have the following 4 values: ['Mumbai', 'Seattle', 'Cairo', 'London']

You are required to modify the list that is passed. Try doing so without creating any 
extra lists, which would mean an O(1) space complexity.

Hint 1:
Insert the element at the 0th position and shift all the elements to the next position.

Hint 2:
Use set method to modify elements at existing position.

Hint 3:
When you come to the last element use >add method of the List.

SOLUTION:

public void insertAtStart(String cityName, List<String> cities) {
    // Add the city name at the end of the list
    cities.add(cityName);
    // Shift all cities to the next position (from the end towards the start)
    for (Integer i = cities.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        cities.set(i + 1, cities.get(i));
    }
    // Insert the cityName at the 0th position
    cities.set(0, cityName);
}
